# KiiDecrypt
An experimental decryption tool for Keys, NAND, and ROMs. 
NOTE: THIS TOOL IS COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL AT THE MOMENT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ACTUALLY USING THIS TO DO WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR. PLEASE WAIT FOR A STABLE RELEASE THEN IT MIGHT WORK. IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN GET IT NOW ANYWAY. 
Also, please do not ask me in any way for the Source Code of this tool. I'm going to keep it private for a LONG TIME if not forever.
